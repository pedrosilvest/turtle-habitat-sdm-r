---

This repository contains the R code and analysis for a Species Distribution Model (SDM) predicting global habitat suitability for the endangered green sea turtle.

By integrating species occurrence data from **GBIF** with marine environmental predictors from **Bio-Oracle**, this project identifies key ecological drivers and maps potential habitats worldwide.

Developed as a personal project, it demonstrates skills in **spatial analysis**, **data science**, and **ecological modeling** using R.

---

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Rigorous filtering of GBIF occurrence records  
- **Environmental Integration:** 12 marine environmental variables from Bio-Oracle  
- **Modeling:** Generalized Linear Model (GLM)  
- **Validation:** 70/30 train-test split with an AUC of **0.97**

## Key Results

The model highlights **warm, shallow coastal waters** in tropical and subtropical regions as prime habitatsâ€”aligning with known sea turtle hotspots such as:

- The Caribbean  
- The Coral Triangle  
- The Great Barrier Reef
