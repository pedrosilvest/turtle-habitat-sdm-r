This repository contains the R code and analysis for a Species Distribution Model (SDM) predicting the global habitat suitability for the endangered green sea turtle. By integrating species occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) with marine environmental data from Bio-Oracle, this project identifies key environmental drivers and maps potential habitats worldwide.

This analysis was developed as a personal project for learning and demonstrating skills in spatial analysis, data science, and ecological modeling in R.

### Key Features:
-   **Data Cleaning:** Rigorous filtering of GBIF occurrence records.
-   **Environmental Data Integration:** Assembling a comprehensive stack of 12 relevant marine predictors from Bio-Oracle.
-   **Robust Modeling:** Using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for prediction.
-   **Model Validation:** Implementing a train-test split (70/30) to ensure an unbiased performance evaluation, achieving an **AUC of 0.97**.

## üìà Key Results

The model successfully identifies warm, shallow coastal waters in tropical and subtropical regions as prime habitats, aligning closely with known turtle congregation areas in the Caribbean, the Coral Triangle, and the Great Barrier Reef.
